About connect problem of smartphone and T97 smartwatch by DaFit.apk

1. Install DaFit.apk to smartphone.
2. Start DaFit app.
3. Exit DaFit app.
4. Overwrite content of "com.crrepa.band.dafit" to "/data/data/com.crrepa.band.dafit" folder using root explorer or adb etc..
   I extracted files only exactly need.
   It's need root permission for access that folder.
   I don't mind of it because you have installed app on smartphone.
5. Start DaFit app again and you can see T97 device of it's mac address.

I have tested it all on offline.
If have any other issues for it, please resend me message.
